			<p>	My name is Mya Nguyen. I am 19 and from Draper, Utah. I graduated high school last year and have been working as a men's wedding band finisher for the past year. I have 3 sisters and 1 brother, so a typical Utah family. I love anything to do with music, whether it is making or listening to it. I play the drums and try to play the guitar. I also love to skateboard and longboard, and have dabbled in making my own in the past.
			</p>
			I applied for this bootcamp, because I really want to move to England. Unfortunately, it's really difficult to get a work visa when you have no special skills or higher education. I am super stoked to be apart of the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp so I can hopefully increase my paycheck and gain a valuable skill.
